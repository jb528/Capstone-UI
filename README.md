DogPro UI

DogPro Web Application

Short Project Description
DogPro is a comprehensive web application designed to simplify and manage all aspects of dog care. It provides a user-friendly interface where dog owners can create, update, and manage pet profiles.

Overview
The DogPro web application incorporates a front-end User Interface (UI) layer that handles user interactions and communicates with the back-end service layer. It visually represents data retrieved from the service layer, providing dog owners a convenient platform to manage their pets' profiles.

How It Works
The UI layer of DogPro presents the user with an interactive interface where they can enter, modify, or view data. When user actions require data to be fetched or stored, the UI sends requests to the service layer. The responses received are then processed and displayed to the user intuitively. This process allows for efficient management of various dog profiles and tracking schedules and training plans.

Design Documents
All relevant design documents related to the UI layer are available in the design folder. These documents provide comprehensive insights into the User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) design elements that enhance the usability and look and feel of the application.
